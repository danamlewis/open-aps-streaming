## Downloader Web App

### Purpose
Prior to this application, OpenAPS staff relied on manual and time-intensive processes to extract and distribute the data held within the OpenAPS Data Commons to researchers. The purpose of this application therefore was to replace the manual elements of this process with an automated solution, which would reduce the input required from OpenAPS staff, and provide researchers with faster and more comprehensive access to data from the OpenAPS data commons.

In addition, this application hosts several dashboards which researchers can use to gain light analytical insights regarding data from the OpenAPS Data Commons, such as number of donatees and common trends of glucose levels.
